# Dark Mode Toggle Project
This project is a simple web application that allows users to toggle between dark and light modes. It features a stylish switch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In dark mode, the background is black, and in light mode, it is white. The switch is styled to provide a smooth transition between the modes with an animation.



## Project Overview
This project is designed to provide users with a straightforward way to switch between dark and light modes. The dark mode is not only visually appealing but can also be easier on the eyes, especially in low-light conditions.
## Features
-Dark mode and light mode toggle.
-Smooth transition animation.
-Persistent mode selection using Local Storage.
## Usage
The project consists of three files:

1.index.html: This is the main HTML file, containing the structure of the page.
2.index.js: This JavaScript file handles the functionality of the dark mode toggle and Local Storage.
3.style.css: The CSS file that styles the page and the dark mode switch.
